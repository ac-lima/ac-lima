I am a geographer (BSc) and earth scientist (MSc) specialized in geomatics and glaciers, with interests in 3D modelling, time-serie analysis, photogrametry, UAVs remote sensing and data analysis. My master's thesis focused on 3D modelling, surface lowering and backwasting analysis on supraglacial lakes and ice-cliffs in Tapado Glacier, Chile from 1955-2023. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on an open geodatabase of Last Global Maximum (LGM) paleoglaciers in alpine environments within The Past, Present and Future of Alpine Biomes Worldwide (PPF-Alpine) project.
